AI Tutor for Computer Networking

<!-- Optional: Add a logo if you have one -->
Overview

The AI Tutor for Computer Networking is an intelligent, interactive tool designed to help students navigate through the renowned textbook "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" by James Kurose and Keith Ross. This app not only provides access to the textbook itself but also offers an AI-powered tutor that can answer questions, clarify concepts, and guide students through the complexities of computer networking.

Unlike generic AI models, this AI Tutor is enhanced with a custom assistant that has a working memory of the textbook. This feature enables the AI to provide more relevant, context-aware responses that are directly tied to the content of the book.
Features

    Interactive PDF Viewer: Students can read the "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" textbook directly within the app.
    AI-Powered Tutor: A custom assistant built using OpenAI's Assistants API, capable of answering questions related to the textbook with context-aware responses.
    Working Memory: The AI retains a memory of the bookâ€™s content, enabling it to reference specific sections and provide detailed explanations tailored to the user's query.
    User-Friendly Interface: The app is designed with simplicity in mind, offering an intuitive interface where students can easily switch between reading and asking questions.

How It Works

    Read the Textbook: The app features an embedded PDF viewer that allows you to read "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" by James Kurose and Keith Ross.
